## How to use the Chrome-Extension

Since I have not published the extension, the Chrome Extension will have to be manually installed in the Chrome Browser.

1. Clone the respository.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Now open google chrome and go the extensions section.
4. Switch on the developers mode.
5. Now, you will see the section to _include an extension_
6. Select the unziped folder.
7. Enjoy the Extension and **keep your Calendar GREEN**
